# 👩‍💻 Hey there, I'm Vaishnavi!

2nd-year B.Tech CSE student on a mission to become a Full Stack Web Developer.

🌱 Currently building a strong foundation in **DSA using C++** to sharpen problem-solving skills.

💻 Actively learning and implementing **HTML5, CSS3, Taiwind CSS, JavaScript, Python ,ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB** — step by step, project by project.

🚀 I’ve just started my journey into serious development — focused on writing clean code, understanding real-world concepts, and building impactful projects.

✨ Passionate about web design, user experience, and bringing ideas to life through code.

💡 Always learning | 🛠️ Always building | 🤝 Open to collaboration and growth!
🧠 I believe in consistency over perfection, learning by doing, and always staying curious.
